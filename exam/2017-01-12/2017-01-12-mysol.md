```

div > ul#todo .important { color: green }       /* R4 */
ul li.postponed { color: inherit }              /* R5 */
li + li + li { color: magenta }                 /* R6 */
```

###### Item (a)

Calculate the specificity of each one of the rules (e.g. 0,2,2,1):
| R1      | R2      | R3      | R4      | R5      | R6      |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0,0,1,1 | 0,0,0,2 | 0,1,1,2 | 0,1,1,2 | 0,0,1,2 | 0,0,0,3 |

###### Item (b)

Taking into consideration only the rules R1 to R3, indicate the color of each of the texts in the page:

| Buy Bread | Learn Guitar | Pay Bills | Wash Car |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| blue      | red          | red       | red      |

###### Item (c)

| Buy Bread | Learn Guitar | Pay Bills | Wash Car |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| blue      | red          | green     | cyan     |

##### Question 2
Consider the following string:
```txt
Washing the washing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing
```
For each one of the regular expressions shown below, underline the first match:

###### Item (a)
`/wa.*ing/`
```txt
Washing the [washing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing]
```

###### Item (b)
`/[a-z]{3}\b/`
```txt
Wash[ing] the washing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing
```

###### Item (c)
`/(ing).*?\1/`
```txt
Wash[ing the washing] machine while watching the washing machine washing washing
```

###### Item (d)
`/^.{3}/`
```txt
[Was]hing the washing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing
```

###### Item (e)
`/(sh|ch)(?!ing)/`
```txt
Washing the washing ma[ch]ine while watching the washing machine washing washing
```

###### Item (f)
`/(.+?).*?\1/`
```txt
W[ashing the wa]shing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing
```

##### Question 3

Consider the following HTML code excerpt:

```html
<div id ="products">
  <ul>
    <li>Apple:<span class="qty">3</span><a href="#">+</a></li>
    <li>Banana:<span class="qty">5</span><a href="#">+</a></li>
    <li>Pear:<span class="qty">6</span><a href="#">+</a></li>
  </ul>
  <a href="#" class="buy">Buy</a>
  <p class="total">0</a>
</div>
```

Also consider that the complete page can have other `a`, `ul` and `li` elements. Write the *jQuery* code needed so that:

###### Item (a)

When the link at the end of each list item is clicked, the quantity of that item is incremented by one.

```js
const anchorsList = document.querySelectorAll('#products ul li a');
const spansList   = document.querySelectorAll('#products ul li span');
for(let i = 0; i < anchorsList.length; ++i){
  const anchor = anchorsList[i];
  const span   = spansList  [i];
  anchor.addEventListener('click', function(){
    span.innerHTML = `${parseInt(span.innerHTML)+1}`;
  });
}
```

###### Item (b)

When the link having a class buy is clicked, an array called products, containing a list of all products and their quantities, should be sent in an Ajax POST request to the address calculatetotal.php.

When the result of that request is received, the text of the paragraph total should be replaced
by the received result (or by not enough stock if the received result is less than 0).

Example of the array to be sent:
```json
[{"name":"Apple","qty":3},{"name":"Banana","qty":5},{"name":"Pear","qty":6}]
```

```js
const namesList = [...document.querySelectorAll('#products ul li')].map((x) => x.childNodes[0]);
const buy = document.querySelector('#products a.buy');
const total = document.querySelector('#products .total');
buy.addEventListener('click', function(){
  let request = XMLHTTPRequest();
  request.open('POST', 'calculatetotal.php', true);
  let data = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < namesList.length; ++i){
    data.append({
      "name": namesList[i],
      "qty": parseInt(spansList[i])
    });
    request.onload = function(){
      let q = parseInt(this.requestText);
      if(q < 0) total.innerHTML = "Not enough stock";
      else      total.innerHTML = `${q}`;
    };
    request.send(data);
  }
});
```

##### Question 4

Consider the following XML document:

```xml
<authors>
  <author country="Spain" name="Miguel de Cervantes">
    <book year="1605" type="Novel">Don Quixote</book>
  </author>
  <author country="England" name="William Shakespeare">
    <book year="1599" type="Tragedy">Hamlet</book>
    <book year="1606" type="Tragedy">Macbeth</book>
  </author>
  <author country="Russia" name="Leo Tolstoy">
    <book year="1865" type="Novel">War and Peace</book>
  </author>
  <author country="Portugal" name="Jose Saramago">
    <book year="1995" type="Novel">Ensaio sobre a Cegueira</book>
    <book year="1997" type="Novel">Todos os Nomes</book>
  </author>
</authors>
```

Consider that the context node is the document root. Write the XPath expressions that select the following elements:

###### Item (a)
The name of all authors.

```txt
/authors/author/@name
```

###### Item (b)
The title of all books with type Novel.

```txt
/authors/author/book[@type="Novel"]
```

###### Item (c)
The name of all authors that wrote more than one book.

```txt
/authors/author[count(book)>1]/@name
```

###### Item (d)
The country of origin of the author that wrote *Ensaio sobre a Cegueira*.

```txt
/authors/author/book[text()="Ensaio sobre a Cegueira"]/../@name
```
